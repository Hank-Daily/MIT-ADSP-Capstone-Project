# MIT-ADSP-Capstone-Project
Music Recommendation System

Context: Many music streaming services and digital sellers need to be 
able to make relevant suggestions in order to foster user engagement and 
provide a more tailored service. Consumers today are used to being able to 
click through suggestions that match their preferences in many areas of the 
digital world.

Objective: This project will use the Taste Profile Subset released by The 
Echo Nest as part of the Million Song Dataset and create a recommendation 
model. There are two files in this dataset. One contains the details about the 
song id, titles, release, artist name and the year of release. Second file contains 
the user id, song id and the play count of users. We will explore these two sets 
and merge them before filtering out the unnecessary entries. Then we will build several models to find the best one for recommendations.
